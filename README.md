Decentralize All The Things
===========================

This is what will become the "main" repo of datt. Running this application will
run a "full node" capable of connecting to the datt p2p network and hosting and
relaying content, serving the web client, serving as a rendezvous server for
browser p2p connections, and connecting to the bitcoin p2p network (probably by
including or at least communicating with a locally-run instance of bitcoind).

Until we start adding code, this repo is being used as a way for contributors
to add themselves to the contributors list and gain access to the GitHub org.
